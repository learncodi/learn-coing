<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="modal">The Computer Languages you need to use by building your project are: HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,SQL,PYTHON,JAVA,PHP,BOOTSTRAP,C,C#,C++.</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="modal">Learning To Code teaches you problem solving skills. Learning Programming skills will teach you to approach your work more creatively, solve problems, and practice critical thinking.Coding involves giving a computer tasks while following specific rules and guidelines at a basic level. Once you breakdown a complex problem into a collection of tiny tasks,you can solve massive global challenges. This approach is called reductionism.</button>

      	<p>Reductionism doesn't just work in coding. You can apply it in your life as well.Using a systematic approach can help you become a better planner and time manager.It also teaches you to pay close attention to detail and avoid careless mistakes in the real world.After all,one misplaced colon,period, or comma in your code can break your program.Have you ever heard of bugs in programs? They definitely aren't creepy-crawlies.So, I decided to make this website for you to learn about coding and for you to build your own website or applications.</p>
